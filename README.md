# Fibonacci and Automated Testing Code
This project was conducted as a group in a DevOps course when creating a REST API pipeline. The REST API contains a Dockerfile, an interactive command line interface, automated testing, and our API pipeline contents. The REST API project is located in my repositiories as "Project_API-1." This repository consists of the fibonacci code I created to test user inputs agaisnt expected outcomes. This also contains the automated testing code I created to test the REST API user inputs for each of the five endpoints and changes made to the pipeline in real time.
